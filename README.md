# 🧠 Garvit | 15 y/o Hobby Dev

Hey, I'm Garvit — a teen dev from Jaipur messing around with code for fun.  
I build stuff that makes life easier (or just cooler).  
Currently playing with:

- 🎯 Academic Planner App (for school, coaching, and self-study)
- 🧠 AI-generated YouTube Shorts Automation
- 🐍 Custom Snake Game (with Pygame just for the hell of it)
- 🔁 Workflows using n8n, Automa, and Figma APIs
